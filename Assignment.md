# CS099 Final Project - Make a Game

Using your programming knowledge and p5.js, you are to make your own game.

## Game Design Document

Create a **`GameDesign.md`** file.

### High Concept

As clearly and simply as you can, explain your game idea.

### Theme

Your game must adhere to the following theme: **Take One, Leave The Rest**

    - The theme/setting/scenario/mechanic of your game must be something that involves this theme.


Explain how your game idea works with the theme.

### Mock Ups

Create a visual flow of the User Experience (How will people interact with the program and what will they see when doing so?)

Visually draw out things like Main Menu, Credits, Options, Play etc...

Provide a rough drawing of what the play scene(s) look like. How is it organized? What is the User Interface? How do players interact with the game?

We are looking for rough sketches, flow charts and concept images.

## Programming Concepts

Create a **`ProgrammingConcepts.md`** file.

You must create a document that explains the following:

**In your own words**, explain the following programming topics. 

Topics:

1. Shapes
2. Colors
3. Variables
4. Conditional Statements
5. Loops
6. Functions
7. Classes
8. Arrays

Tip: For each topic think about the What, Why and How. Like, What is it? Why is it important? How do we use it?

After each topic explanation, provide a small code snippet from your game project that shows you using the topic.

## Requirements

- This is an individual project, so no teams allowed.
- All audio files must be self-created or license for free use for students
    - Create a `Media.md` file that describes how you made the audio and/or where you got it from. If you got the audio from somewhere, then you must also list it's license information. If you can't find the license information then you can't use it.
- All image files must be self-created or license for free use for students
    - Create a `Media.md` file that describes how you made the image and/or where you got it from. If you got the image from somewhere, then you must also list it's license information. If you can't find the license information then you can't use it.
- The game must be hosted on the Internet via GitHub.
- Other than p5.js, all code must be your own. Any other third party libraries must be pre-approved by the instructor.

## Submission

**You must host your project on [GitHub](https://youtu.be/ZneWjyn18e8)**. Submit the URL of your project as part of your submission on the course site.

Create a `Media.md` file that describes all media file information.

Submit a `GameDesign.md` and `ProgrammingConcepts.md` documents, which match the descriptions described above.

You will be submitting a zip file of your work.

The name of the ZIP file must follow this naming convention: `[class_name]_[login]_game.zip`

For example, if a student had the login name fun.frank then the appropriate filename would be `cs099_fun.frank_game.zip`. Note: The .zip file names are case-sensitive and must be in all lowercase, exactly as described above.

## Grading Rubric

- [ ] Zip file has all the required files. **NOTE:** If we can't build and run your game then you will receive a **Zero**
- [ ] The zip file submitted can be extracted and the sketch runs in Chrome with a local web server.
- [ ] Published the project on GitHub.
- [ ] Properly documented media files in a `Media.md`.
- [ ] **All** Source Code has a proper header comment: Name, Project Name, Course Number, Term & Year. 
- [ ] Properly named zip file.
- [ ] Game Design Document
- [ ] [**core**] Programming Concepts document
- [ ] [**core**] Implemented your own game using `p5.js`


Scores for Assignments will be given as the following:

Score        | Assessment
------------ | ----------
Zero         | Nothing turned in at all
Failing      | Close to meeting core requirements
Rudimentary  | Meets all of the core requirements
Satisfactory | Close to meeting all requirements
Good         | Clearly meets all requirements 
Excellent    | High quality, well beyond the requirements
